# Era Events

An [AzerothCore](https://www.azerothcore.org/) (WotLK 3.3.5a) module that brings back the iconic
world events of each era as **timed live events**, for servers running
[mod-individual-progression](https://github.com/ZhengPeiRu21/mod-individual-progression).

With individual progression, every character is in its own era. IP already sets the scene for
each one (the War Effort, the outdoor AQ war, the Scourge Invasion's necropolises, the Legion at
the Dark Portal), but nothing ever *happens* there. This module adds the moments:

| Event | Era (IP tier) | What happens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Gates of Ahn'Qiraj** | 4: the gong is rung | The Qiraji swarm storms out of the Scarab Wall in waves against a line of Kaldorei infantry. Merithra, Arygos and Caelestrasz join in one after another and strafe the swarm, then Lieutenant General Nokhor leads the last push. Also breaks out **the moment anyone bangs the gong**. |
| **Scourge Invasion** | 6: after AQ, before Naxxramas | Takes turns: a Pallid Horror or Patchwork Terror marches through Stormwind or Undercity dragging Flameshockers along, or the Herald of the Lich King raises three rare elites and a stream of minions beside a necropolis. |
| **Legion Incursion** | 7: after Naxxramas, before the Dark Portal | A fel portal tears open outside Gadgetzan, Everlook, Cenarion Hold, Nethergarde Keep or Light's Hope Chapel. Demons march on the town in waves, a Dreadlord leads the middle one and a Pit Commander comes through last. |
| **Zombie Infestation** | 12: the end of TBC, before Northrend | The 3.0.2 plague in Stormwind or Orgrimmar. Plagued grain crates, rising dead, **infection** ("You're Infected!"), Argent Healers who cure it, and if you're not cured in time you **turn into a zombie** with the original zombie form and its action bar. Your groan infects the living around you. |

## Shared, but only with your era

- **Only your era sees it.** Everything an event spawns sits in a phase of its own, and a character
  is phased in only while standing in the event's zone *and* at the event's tier. Someone at a
  different stage in the same city sees nothing and isn't attacked.
- **Needs company.** A scheduled event only starts when at least **2 real players** at that tier
  are online (`EraEvents.MinRealPlayers`). Playerbots and GMs don't count towards that, but
  playerbots at the tier are phased in and fight alongside you. The gong is the one exception: it
  starts the AQ war even for a single player.
- **Announced.** Everyone at the tier gets a warning 10 minutes before (on screen and in chat)
  saying where, then a message when it starts and when it ends.
- **Rewarded.** Win it and everyone phased in gets gold, reputation (Cenarion Circle for AQ, Argent
  Dawn for the rest) and, for the Scourge Invasion, Necrotic Runes. All configurable. Items go
  by mail when bags are full.

Each event runs on its own schedule: a random 2 to 4 hours between chances by default. When
it's due but too few players are online, it checks again every 5 minutes.

## Commands

| Command | Who | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.era next` | everyone | Your era's event, whether it's running, and when the next chance comes. |
| `.era list` | GM | Every event, its tier, state and timer, and how many real players are at its tier. |
| `.era start <aq\|si\|legion\|zombie>` | GM | Start an event now, skipping the notice and the player count. |
| `.era stop <aq\|si\|legion\|zombie>` | GM | End a running event and despawn it. |

To test an event, put a character at its tier with `.ip set <tier>` (IP's command), go to the zone and
`.era start <event>`.

## Requirements

- [AzerothCore](https://www.azerothcore.org/) wotlk (master) and a WoW 3.3.5a (12340) client.
- [mod-individual-progression](https://github.com/ZhengPeiRu21/mod-individual-progression) with
  `IndividualProgression.Enable = 1`. Events are tied to its progression tiers; with IP off no
  era has players. The module reads IP's hidden progression quests and config but doesn't link
  against it.
- No client patch. [mod-playerbots](https://github.com/mod-playerbots/mod-playerbots) is optional:
  bots at the tier are phased in and fight alongside you.

## Installation

Clone it into your AzerothCore `modules` folder **as `mod-era-events`**, without the repo's `wow-`
prefix. AzerothCore finds the module's entry point from the folder name.

```bash
cd <azerothcore>/modules
git clone https://github.com/buildthehomelab/wow-mod-era-events.git mod-era-events
```

Rebuild the worldserver, then copy `conf/mod_era_events.conf.dist` to your config folder as
`mod_era_events.conf`. The world database updates add the event creatures and the phase auras on
the next start.

No client patch is needed: everything uses spells and models the 3.3.5 client already has.

## Configuration

See `conf/mod_era_events.conf.dist`.

| Option | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EraEvents.Enable` | 1 | Master switch. |
| `EraEvents.MinRealPlayers` | 2 | Real players at the tier who must be online for a scheduled event to start. |
| `EraEvents.RetryMinutes` | 5 | How often a due event checks again while waiting for players. |

Each event (`AQWar`, `ScourgeInvasion`, `LegionIncursion`, `ZombieInfestation`) has its own set,
for example `EraEvents.ScourgeInvasion.Enable`:

| Option | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.Enable` | 1 | 0 never runs it; GMs can't start it either. |
| `.IntervalMin` / `.IntervalMax` | 120 / 240 | Minutes between one event and the next chance, picked at random. |
| `.WarningMinutes` | 10 | Notice before it starts. 0 starts it straight away. |
| `.DurationMinutes` | 30 (AQ 45) | How long players have before the event gives up. |
| `.RewardGold` | 15-50 | Gold for everyone taking part when it's won. |
| `.RewardFaction` / `.RewardReputation` | 609 or 529 / 150-250 | Reputation reward. Faction 0 for none. |
| `.RewardItem` / `.RewardItemCount` | 22484 x5 for SI, else none | Item reward. |

The module reads `IndividualProgression.Enable` and `IndividualProgression.ProgressionLimit` from
IP's config: with IP off no era has players, and an event whose tier is beyond the progression
limit never runs.

## How it works

- A character's era is read from IP's hidden progression quests (66000 + tier), the same way IP
  reads it. The module doesn't link against IP.
- Each event owns a phase bit IP doesn't use (IP uses 16-21, this module 22-25) and a server-side
  aura that adds it, like IP's own "Phase Shift" auras. The two stack, so IP's phasing in the same
  zones keeps working.
- An event spawns an invisible anchor and summons everything else from it, so it all inherits the
  event's phase. The anchor keeps the area loaded and updating while nobody is near.
- The creatures are copies of Blizzard's, with this module's scripts: the originals' own scripts
  write the core's global Scourge Invasion state or run the Ahn'Qiraj quest flashback.

## IDs used

- `creature_template` 9500800-9500809 (Scourge Invasion), 9500810-9500818 (AQ), 9500820-9500827
  (Legion), 9500850-9500853 (Zombie)
- `gameobject_template` 9500854 (plagued grain crate)
- `spell_dbc` 90120-90123 (phase auras)
- `spell_script_names` 56560 (Beckoning Groan, on the zombie form's bar)
- phase bits 22-25 (4194304, 8388608, 16777216, 33554432)

## Notes

- The Scourge Invasion here is its own, not the core's world event (game event 17). Leave that one
  off; mod-individual-progression disables it too.
- Zombie players get the invasion's faction for as long as they're turned, so the dead leave them
  alone. City guards don't: turning in the middle of Stormwind is dangerous.
- Events don't survive a restart: a running event is simply gone, and the schedule starts over.

## Troubleshooting

- **An event never starts by itself:** a scheduled event needs at least 2 real players at its tier
  online (`EraEvents.MinRealPlayers`), and bots and GMs don't count. It checks again every 5
  minutes. Also check `EraEvents.Enable`, the event's own `.Enable`, and that its tier isn't past
  `IndividualProgression.ProgressionLimit`.
- **You can't see a running event:** only characters standing in the event's zone and at its tier
  are phased in. Check your tier with `.era next`, and set a test character's with `.ip set <tier>`.
- **Testing an event:** a GM can run `.era start <aq|si|legion|zombie>`, which skips the notice and
  the player count, and `.era stop` to end it.
- **Two Scourge Invasions at once:** the core's game event 17 is on. Leave it off.
